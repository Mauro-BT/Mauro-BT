# 👋 Welcome — I’m Learning Cybersecurity Through Focused, Hands-On Work

I'm a military veteran transitioning into cybersecurity, with a background in aircraft maintenance. I spent years troubleshooting complex systems where accuracy, accountability, and clear procedures weren’t optional—they were survival.

That mindset now shapes how I approach security: learn the tools, build the process, document everything, and keep improving.

## 🎯 What I'm Working Toward

My current focus is on building foundational skills across three core areas:

- **Malware Analysis** – inspecting suspicious files in isolated environments
- **Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)** – analyzing memory and system artifacts after compromise
- **SOC Operations** – collecting logs, reviewing alerts, and understanding how security events unfold

I’m not just watching tutorials—I’m building my own labs, repeating tasks until they make sense, and documenting both the wins and the mistakes.

## 🧪 Key Project

### [🛡️ Cybersecurity Lab Series](https://github.com/Mauro-BT/Cybersecurity-Lab-Series)
A collection of self-guided labs where I explore malware analysis, forensics, and log-based alert triage.

Each lab includes:
- A practical objective
- A setup I’ve configured and tested
- Notes, IOCs, and walkthroughs
- A reflection on what I understood—and what I didn’t (yet)

## 🧭 Tools I’m Working With

These are the platforms and tools I’m **getting familiar with** through repeated use in my labs:

- FLARE VM, PEStudio, Strings
- REMnux, Volatility
- Splunk, Suricata, Wireshark, Sysmon
- MITRE ATT&CK, PCAP analysis, Windows event logs

Some I can set up from scratch. Others I’m still learning to use effectively. The goal is clarity and confidence through repetition—not shortcuts.
